        Bundles are collections of cosmetics that can either be usually bought individually or all together for a reduced bundle price. Most bundles are for new cosmetic collections when they are first released into the game, though others, such as the Run It Back and Give Back collections, contain previously released cosmetics.

        Each bundle will always contain weapon skins and as usually as standard comes with a total of five. Some will also contain buddies, player cards, and sprays, and as standard comes with a total of one each.
        
        If choosing to buy as a bundle, some of the cosmetics are either discounted or become free. For bundles with a melee, the bundle price is equal to the total cost of the gun skins, and any sprays, buddies, and cards are given for free (though some bundles with a non-standard amount of accessories may only be discounted instead of offering them for free). For bundles without a melee, all weapons receive a discount of around 33% off when contributing to the bundle price.
        
        All bundles are only available for a limited time of about one to three weeks. After they are retired from the store, players will no longer be able to obtain any buddies, player cards, or sprays that came from that bundle. Weapon skins however can still become available (excluding limited edition bundles) by other means through the store's daily offers, a Night.Market, or special bundles like the Run It Back and Give Back bundles.
